Your new Encrypted .Pak will be in C: Drive.

Create your own bypass to load .paks in-game




Step 1) Get UnrealEngine. Build it. Your Binaries directory will now have an .exe called "UnrealPak.exe". (Or otherwise obtain UnrealPak.exe)

Step 2) Make yourself a response file "UC_PAK.txt" in your path above your pak contents with text like:

			X:\TslGame\*

Step 3) Run unrealpak, that references your response file:

			"C:\UnrealPak.exe" C:\UC_PAK.pak -create=C:\UC_PAK.txt -compress -encrypt -encryptindex -aes=45DD15D6DD2DA50AEB71CE7A5284CF8EA498B2EC3D52B7E336F3EA0071CE44B3

Step 4) Install and use the pak file, QC.pak.

Step 5) Get your pubg account banned. I do not use this. You will be banned for most of the things you are thinking of putting in your paks. However, the above will get past the first step and allow it to load the pak again.
